> Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br />
> Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br />
> Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,<br />
> One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br />
> <br />
> In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br />
> One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br />
> One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br />
> In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br />

â€” J.R.R. Tolkien's epigraph to The Lord of the Rings
